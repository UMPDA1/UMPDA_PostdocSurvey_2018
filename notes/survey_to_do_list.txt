x Find what happened to non-binary responses in text analysis
	x Also verify inclusion in other plots
	x Update: only had one repsonder classified as non-binary but they didn't answer some of the questions so their inclusion as a category is sporadic throughout the gender section
x Add lines to stratified multichoice question plots representing relative percentages from unstratified data
x Fix plotting of multichoice questions
	x Some need to be plotted differently (aka not as bar charts)
	x Fix text wrapping/cut off in plot titles
x Add question numbers to all plot titles
x Play around with wordcloud plot features (font size, bold, etc.)
	x Font, font size, strip label sizes, etc.
	x Try to match up with multichoice plots

- Academic - teaching, academic - research to academic (teaching), academic (research)
- Reorganize so it's "agree", "neutral", "disagree" and "yes", "no"
- Change question numbers so they go from 1 through n without missing any
	- Need to be careful because some question numbers are hard coded so it could break scripts
- Add question number tag to location plots
- Go back through and clean up scripts where necessary
